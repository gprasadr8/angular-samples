Whatever we write in java script it's a valid typescript, because typescript is a superset of javascript.

\- write code in a file with .ts extension and compile it by using ***\*tsc\**** typescript compiler cmd. it will convert .ts file to .js file.

\- If we run with -w cmd option in tsc then it will watch for the changes on ts file without terminating the tsc cmd.

  tsc index.ts -w

  

\- we can even use https://stackblitz.com/edit/typescript online typescript env setup
